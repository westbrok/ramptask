                   </p> 
                  

<p>What is the purpose of this research study? </p> 
<p>The purpose of this project is to study your performance on a series of computerized tasks as it relates to learning and decision making. 
In order to participate in this study you must be healthy, between the ages of 18 and 40, and have no medical history of brain injury, mental/psychiatric disorders or drug or alcohol abuse. 

</p>
<p>What will happen during this study? </p> 
<p>You will be asked to complete a computerized task in which you will make decisions on various stimuli depending on the instructions and memory requirements for the task.  You may also be asked to complete some brief questionnaires, which may ask for sensitive personal information, such as specifics concerning your menstrual cycle. You are allowed to skip any questions which you do not wish to answer.    
It should be understood that there may be certain aspects of the study session which will not be fully disclosed until after your participation is complete. Upon completion of the study session, you will be given a full debriefing describing all research procedures and contact information by the experimenter. Any questions you may have will also be addressed. 

</p>
<p>How long will I be in this study? </p> 
<p>The length of your participation may range from approximately 10 minutes to 1 hour. You will be notified of the duration of your participation prior to beginning. 

</p>
<p>Will there be any costs to me? </p> 
<p>Aside from your time, there are no costs for taking part in the study. 

</p> 
<p>Are there any risks to me? </p> 
<p>There are no risks to you for participating. 

</p>
<p>Are there any benefits to me? </p> 
<p>There is no direct benefit to you for participating.  However, your education in psychology may be enhanced by learning about the psychological concepts investigated in this study, the relevance of these concepts to everyday life, and how psychological research is conducted. 

</p>
<p>Will I be paid to participate in the study? </p> 
<p>Monetary compensation will be provided to you through your Amazon.com Mechanical Turk member account. You will be compensated $0.08 per minute ($0.80 per 10 minutes) or for certain sessions based on your performance. If your compensation will be based on performance, you will be notified prior to beginning and given the option of abstaining participation.

</p>  
<p>Will the information that is obtained from me be kept confidential?</p> 
<p>Your records will be confidential. You will not be identified in any reports or publications resulting from the study.  It is possible that representatives of the sponsor that supports the research study will want to come to Brown University to review your information.  Representatives of regulatory agencies (including the Brown University Human Research Protection Program) may access your records.  You may be asked for your Amazon.com Mechanical Turk username and email address for the purpose of compensation through Mechanical Turk member services, however, research personnel will not have access to your bank information at any time. All experiments conducted online are hosted on a Brown University secure server. Your data, including responses to questionnaires, will be maintained on a password-protected database on that server. Your email address will be maintained in a location that is separate from the rest of your information. To preserve confidentiality, you will be assigned a number and you will automatically be identified on all forms by number only such that your name and data collected about you are not linked in any way. Furthermore, any data stored on a computer will reference you only by this number. Only investigators delegated to this study will have access to this data and none of this data will be shared with third parties. In general, neither we nor anyone can absolutely guarantee the security of data transmitted over the web. 
This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers with this Certificate may not disclose or use information, documents, or biospecimens that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other action, suit, or proceeding, or be used as evidence, for example, if there is a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use. Information, documents, or biospecimens protected by this Certificate cannot be disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the research except, if there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to report child abuse or communicable diseases but not for federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, see below); if you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or if it is used for other scientific research, as allowed by federal regulations protecting research subjects.

</p>
<p>May I change my mind about participating? </p> 
<p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decide to not begin or to stop the study at any time.

</p>
